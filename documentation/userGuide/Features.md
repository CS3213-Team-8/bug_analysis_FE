### Feature: Get Bug Solution

This feature allows you to get a solution for the bug you are currently viewing.

<box type="warning" seamless>
The solution is generated using AI tools, so accuracy is not guaranteed. Always verify the solution before applying it to your code!
</box>

<box type="info">
<h5 style="color:green; margin-bottom: 5px;">User Story</h5>
As a DBMS developer, I can view a suggested solution for the bug I am currently viewing based on the bug report, so that I can resolve the bug quickly and reduce debugging time.
</box>

### Feature: Bugs filtering

This feature allows you to filter bug reports based on:

- Whether they were discovered by SQLancer
- Category
- DBMS
  (read the following feature sections for more details)

<box type="tip" seamless>

##### Tips for Using Search and Filters Effectively

1. **Use the top search bar** to locate specific bug issues by entering relevant keywords.

2. **Search filters are persistent**â€”when loading more issues, your search is retained automatically.

3. **All filters remain active** across paginated results. When you click **"LOAD MORE"**, newly loaded issues will also respect the current filters.

4. If no results appear for your selected filter(s), try clicking **"LOAD MORE"** to fetch additional relevant issues.

5. Selecting **"All"** will reset all filters and display the complete list of bug reports.

6. **Combine multiple filters** for more refined resultsâ€”e.g., filter by _Category_, _DBMS_, and whether it was found by _SQLancer_.
