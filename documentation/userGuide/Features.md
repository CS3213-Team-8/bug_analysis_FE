### Feature: Analyse Mean Time-to-Fix (TTF) across DBMSs

This feature allows you to view the Mean Time-to-Fix (TTF) for each DBMS (in hours).

<box type="warning"  icon="ðŸ‘¤">
<h6 style="color: black; margin-bottom: 2px;">Who is it for?</h6>
<ul>
<li> SQLancer and Database Developers who want to manage the resolution of bugs in the DBMSs. </li>
</ul>
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>
Time-to-Fix (TTF) is calculated as the difference in hours between the time the bug was reported (issue created on GitHub) and the time it was resolved (issue closed on GitHub).
</box>

<pic src="../images/mean-ttf.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
Mean-TTF Feature
</pic>

**Key Capabilities**:
* It displays the TTF for each DBMS in a bar chart format, making it easy to compare the TTF across different DBMSs.
* The TTF is calculated using the issue creation and resolution dates from the GitHub API.
* The TTF is displayed in hours, providing a clear and comparable metric for each DBMS.

<panel header="**Steps to use**" type="success" expanded>

  1. Go to the **Visualization** Page.  
  2. View the bar chart displaying the Mean TTF for each DBMS.  
  <div style="text-align: center;">

### Feature: View Bugs Distribution across different Categories

This feature allows you to view the distribution of bugs across different categories, for each DBMS.

<box type="warning"  icon="ðŸ‘¤">
<h6 style="color: black; margin-bottom: 2px;">Who is it for?</h6>
<ul>
<li> SQLancer Developer who wants to compare the types/categories of database bugs reported across different DBMS to identiify common vulnerabilities and areas where SQLancer's testing could be improved. </li>
</ul>
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>
Currently, the categories are fixed and set by the development team. The categories are: <strong>Security Vulnerabilities</strong>, <strong>Build Issues</strong>, <strong>Performance Bugs</strong>, <strong>Join Processing Bugs</strong>, <strong>Query Optimization Bugs</strong>, <strong>Predicate Evaluation Bugs</strong>, <strong>Suggestions</strong> (and <strong>Others</strong> as a catch-all).
</box>
<box type="warning" seamless>
Currently, the classification of bugs into categories is done using AI tools, so accuracy is not guaranteed.

      <li>Scalability (e.g., handles data growth and traffic)</li>
    </ul>
  </panel>  
  <br>

  4. **Review the Suggested DBMS**.  
  The system will suggest a DBMS along with a rationale for its selection. Review the suggestion to ensure it fits your project needs.
