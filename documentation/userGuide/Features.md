<ul>
<li> SQLancer and Database Developers who want to manage the resolution of bugs in the DBMSs. </li>
</ul>
</box>

<box type="tip" seamless>
Time-to-Fix (TTF) is calculated as the difference in hours between the time the bug was reported (issue created on GitHub) and the time it was resolved (issue closed on GitHub).
</box>

<pic src="../images/mean-ttf.png" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
Mean-TTF Feature

**Key Capabilities**:

- It displays the TTF for each DBMS in a bar chart format, making it easy to compare the TTF across different DBMSs.
- The TTF is calculated using the issue creation and resolution dates from the GitHub API.
- The TTF is displayed in hours, providing a clear and comparable metric for each DBMS.

</ul>
</box>

**Key Capabilities**:

- Filter bugs into meaningful categories which helps users quickly drill down into specific problem areas.
- Provides comparision of bug types across DBMSs or isolate categories to assist in triaging and fixing issues relevant to user's domain.
- For SQLancer developers, this feature helps uncover testing gaps by showing which types of bugs are most commonly found or missed by automated testing.
