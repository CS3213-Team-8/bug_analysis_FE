**BugSnapper is a bug analysis platform that visualises and categorises bugs found in popular database systems like DuckDB, TiDB, and CockroachDB. Designed as a companion to SQLancer, it helps developers and DBMS maintainers identify testing priorities, track bug patterns, and make data-driven decisions. Whether you are building a database, or simply looking to use one, BugSnapper gives you all the insights you need.**
